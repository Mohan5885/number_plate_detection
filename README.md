A Number Plate Recognition (NPR) system is a technology that automates the process of identifying and reading vehicle license plate numbers. This system uses advanced image processing techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to analyze images captured by cameras. Initially, the system processes the image to enhance its quality and isolate the number plate region. Once the plate is isolated, character segmentation techniques are employed to separate individual characters. Subsequently, OCR algorithms are applied to recognize each character, often using machine learning techniques to improve accuracy. The recognized characters are then combined to form the complete license plate number. This technology has diverse applications, including traffic management, toll collection, law enforcement, and access control. By automating the process of reading number plates, NPR systems enhance efficiency, accuracy, and security in various domains.
